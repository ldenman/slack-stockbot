* slack-stockbot
A dumb bot that listens and fetches a quote when someone mentions a symbol (ex $AAPL or
$GOOG).

* Deployment

** Heroku

*** Setup
I had to run the following to disable web service. One time.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
heroku ps:scale web=0
heroku ps:scale worker=1
#+END_SRC

The Procfile informs heroku to use a worker but I had to run the commands above
in addition when I was setting up.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git remote add heroku ...
git push heroku master
#+END_SRC

* Development

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm install
  node stockbot.js
  #+END_SRC
